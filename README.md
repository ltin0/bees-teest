# Hello to all team of Bees
First of all i want to thanks the oportunity to do the test for join the team, will be a big pleasure work with all of you

This is my front-end teste using reactJS

You can run this on your local host using : npm start

i already used the librays AXIOS, ROUTE, REACTICONS

I have some issues with routes, that's not working properly, and i still haven't solve the bug.
The issue is on the header of card sect, the back button changes the url, but not render the content.
And the username on header too, is going away with the submit act on first page.

I'm really sorry for that, i'am already still working to fix this, but i'am sending now for not traspassing the deadline.

On the first page, he wave de form with a input text and a checkbox, that's working good, and the data on the input is beign captured( you can check this on console) both inputs are required to advance for the second page.

On the second page, the cards are beign all loaded from the API.

The app is fully responsive, and all the style pages are in "src/components/style"

So anyway, the app is working, but, when the bugs are fixed i commit and send to this repository

#I'am waiting for your feedback, thank you very much.
